This is a starter pack for a React carousel app. It is meant as a practice assignment for someone learning React. The app is half completed but is missing a few implementation details to make it fully functional. Your goal is to fill out or modify the portion of the app with the tag "Your implementation goes here" in order to achieve the following:

1. The React app should be able to exit out of the loading state
2. Clicking on the left and right arrow on the carousel rotates the photos
3. Fix /photos API endpoint to allow the photos to be displayed both at the same time

To begin:

1. clone the app to the local drive
2. install dependencies: `npm install`
3. start app `npm start` in one terminal
4. read through the repository and edit as needed to restore functionalities
5. submit your app to [TODO: email or slack channel](http://example.com) to get an example solution
